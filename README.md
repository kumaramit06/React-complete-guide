This is a demo repository while I am learning React JS . 

<b>How to create React App -> </b> <br/>
    First we need to have node js installed in our machine and will have to use npm command to install React Js in our system . The command to install react is - <br/>
  <i> npm install -g create-react-app </i>
  <br/><br/>
  Then to creat a project we will have to use again npm command <br/>
  <i>create-react-app --version</i>
  <br/> If the above command is not working then try to use the below command to create the project <br/>
  <i>npx create-react-app my-app</i>
